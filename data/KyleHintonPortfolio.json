I had a fun time creating music for kids theatre that used sounds that would sound like mice running around with their dainty and tiny little feet. It’s always really neat to see your musical compositions come to life in stories and theatre. Additionally, I got to create a little suitcase puppet trunk to create the classroom of mice scenes.

This 15-speaker multi-ambient music installation was designed specifically for the Arts Commons +15 Walkway and is dedicated to the memory of Richard McDowell and Michael Green. This soundscape is called “constructed nature”. It’s a multi-dimensional soundscape, made from a collection of thunderstorm samples that have been gathered over the years. It is named “Constructed Nature” because all the samples were taken in an urban environment. While tinkering with the samples, it felt more like constructing nature than re-creating it. The soundscape is an expression of how distant humans are from pure nature. “Constructed Nature” is about how there is a pure definition of “nature”, that is both necessary and unobtainable to us. It is necessary because we need to visualize an ideal form of nature, that we can infinitely go towards. Without a pure definition of nature, we could make up whatever we want about it, and this happens a lot in politics. It becomes a word that can be used in a strategy. So, a true definition, or pure definition is necessary so that it can have substance that is greater than strategy and politics. It becomes something worthwhile to always try to obtain and to accept we will never obtain it. A laptop instrument was created with a video game joystick to play and affect the Thunder samples. It was made in Max/Msp and it can be an interactive sound installation, if desired. To create the track, I recorded myself using the Thunderstorm Patch/instrument, and then did some processing and editing in Ableton.",

Festival and was also presented by Swallow-a-Bicycle. It was also part of a program called the Spark: Artist Performance Tours. There were over a dozen artists involved in the project and each of us got a specific, behind the doors location in the Calgary Tower to create in, including an underground train station. I created a piece called the Multi-Dimensional Emergency Staircase, which, as you could guess was in the emergency staircase of the Calgary Tower, which is the same location I used for the same event in the previous year. Last year, I created a performance/audio piece about Loitering. This year I made an audio only piece about emergencies. The project was site-specific, which means I had to let the space inspire my creation. The Calgary Tower has two stair cases that are criss-crossing to the top of the tower. The criss-crossing stairs make you feel like you are inside of an M.C.Escher drawing. There is a mural on each landing and they are nature themed. Multi-dimensional is a word that definitely describes this space. It is easy to become distracted from the fact that this space is for emergencies but it became the attribute I wanted to focus on. It’s multi-dimensionality inspired me to create something about all Emergencies at once. For me, the goal was to design an audio creation that looks at emergencies universally rather than pinpointing a single one kind of emergency. By using alarms I also wanted to have the audience, for just a split second, think that they are in an emergency and maybe even wonder what they would do in an emergency situation.",
