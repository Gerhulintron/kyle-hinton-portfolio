    <h1>God of Thunder / Mischief Thunder Privacy Policy</h1>
    <pre>

1. Introduction
Welcome to God of Thunder aka Mischief Thunder. This privacy policy explains how our offline game collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you play the game. We value your privacy, and because this game operates completely offline and without network connectivity, we do not collect or transmit any personal or usage data.

2. Information Collection
No Collection of Personal Data

Offline Functionality: God of Thunder aka Mischief Thunder is designed to work completely offline. The game does not require an internet connection and does not interact with any online servers.

No Personal Data: We do not collect, store, or process any personal data such as names, email addresses, or location information.

No User Tracking: There are no background processes, analytics tools, or tracking software installed. No data is being recorded, saved, or transmitted from your device.

3. Data Storage and Usage
Local Storage Only

Local Game Data: Any game-related data (such as your progress, settings, and in-game performance) is stored locally on your device. This data remains solely on your device and is not shared with any third parties.

User Control: Since the data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You may clear or delete your game data at any time using your device’s settings, without impacting any privacy protection since no data is shared externally.

4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
No Tracking Technologies Employed

Cookies: Our game does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies. Since the app is offline and self-contained, there is no mechanism to deploy cookies or to monitor user behavior.

Local Data Only: All game settings and saved data are managed entirely within your device, ensuring that no external tracking or data analytics are conducted.

5. Third-Party Services
No Third-Party Integrations

No External Services: God of Thunder does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or external libraries that could collect or share data.

No Ad Networks: Since the game is offline, it does not include advertisements, and therefore, no ad networks are involved in data collection.

6. Security
Data Safety

Device Security: As no data is transmitted over the internet, the risk of data breaches or external hacking through the game is minimized. However, we recommend that you secure your device with up-to-date security software and practices.

Local Vulnerabilities: Should your device be compromised by malware or unauthorized access, any locally stored data is at risk. The security of locally stored data is ultimately dependent on the device and its security measures.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
Policy Updates

Notification: We reserve the right to update or modify this privacy policy at any time. If significant changes are made, they will be posted on this page along with an updated effective date.

Continued Use: Your continued use of God of Thunder after the changes signifies that you accept the updated terms.

8. Children’s Privacy
Protection of Minors

No Data Collection from Minors: God of Thunder aka Mischief Thunder is intended for users of all ages; however, we do not intentionally collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since the game is offline and does not collect any data, this policy naturally protects younger users.

Parental Guidance: Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise the use of the game, particularly for younger children.

9. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at:

10. Disclaimers
No Legal Advice: This privacy policy is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal advice. We recommend that you consult with a legal professional to ensure that your privacy policy fully complies with all applicable laws.

Offline Nature of the Game: Because God of Thunder operates entirely offline and does not collect or transmit data, many common privacy issues do not apply. However, should the functionality of the game change in the future, this policy may be updated accordingly.
