    <h1>Bunny Runner Privacy Policy</h1>
    <pre>
        Effective Date: October 20 2024

        1. Introduction
        Welcome to Bunny Runner, a game developed by Simulations, with artwork by Imrie, sound by SiLo, and directed by Wetiko. Bunny Runner is part of The Guides Arcade project. This privacy policy outlines how we handle any data collected while you use the Bunny Runner game and associated services.

        2. Optional Data Collection: Player Alias for Scoreboard
        While Bunny Runner does not collect personal information by default, players have the option to submit an alias (a non-identifiable name or nickname) to be displayed on the in-game scoreboard. This alias is entirely optional, and no other personal information will be collected alongside it.

        3. No Data Sharing or Selling
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share any data with third parties. The alias entered for the scoreboard is used solely for in-game purposes and is not shared or used outside of the game environment.

        4. Analytical Information from Google Play and Apple
        In addition to the optional alias for the scoreboard, we may receive aggregated and anonymous analytical data from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This includes:

        Number of downloads.
        In-app performance metrics.
        Crash reports.
        Usage statistics (such as how often the app is used and on what types of devices).
        This information helps us improve the game and optimize the player experience. All such data is anonymous and is not tied to any specific user.

        5. Data Security
        We take the protection of any data seriously. The optional alias for the scoreboard is stored securely, and the analytics data received from Google Play and Apple is in compliance with their privacy standards. No personal information is collected or stored by Bunny Runner.

        6. Player Rights
        Since no personal data is collected, players are not required to submit any information. If you choose to submit an alias for the scoreboard, you may request its removal by contacting us.

        7. Changes to This Policy
        We may update this privacy policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or operational, legal, or regulatory requirements. Any updates will be posted here, and your continued use of Bunny Runner following such updates constitutes your acceptance of the changes.

        8. Contact Us
        If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at kyle-hinton@outlook.com.
