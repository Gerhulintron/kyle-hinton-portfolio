                        I’m feeling incredibly grateful for being part of such a talented project team which included Sarah Johnston, who painted the amazing mural at Twitchin Threadz, and Mackenzie Bedford, who created the fantastic animation which you can find in the Augmented Reality realm using the app called Augle. I’m so stoked to hear my music paired with these phenomenal visuals!</p>

                    <p>Our Canada Our Story was an awesome political/anti-racist theatre project and it was absolutely exciting to design sound for this project with so many artists who were fired up about some topics that typically get swept under the rug. Throughout the creation of this project, I was recording rivers, trains, all kinds of chimes, and most humans. This was an awesome project to design sound for and you can find more info in the following links:</p>

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>For this lovely kids theatre project, I got to create the sound design and compose new electronic music arrangements for this show. The play is about two mice who have different levels of privilege and challenges based on where they reside in their house. One mouse lives nice and close to school and food while another has to always go around a cat to get anything.</p>
                    <p>I had a fun time creating music for kids theatre that used sounds that would sound like mice running around with their dainty and tiny little feet. It’s always really neat to see your musical compositions come to life in stories and theatre.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I got to create a little suitcase puppet trunk to create the classroom of mice scenes. The suitcase allowed actors to control multiple mice-puppet characters at once, inside the classroom scene.</p>

                <h3>Sound Design, Sound Installation</h3>
                <p>November 1 – December 31 2018</p>
                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>Arts Commons Presents brings a new media art sound installation to the +15 hallway that will take you on a journey of meditation. This 15-speaker multi-ambient music installation was designed specifically for the Arts Commons +15 Walkway and is dedicated to the memory of Richard McDowell and Michael Green.</p>
                    <p>This soundscape is called “constructed nature”. It’s a multi-dimensional soundscape, made from a collection of thunderstorm samples that have been gathered over the years. It is named “Constructed Nature” because all the samples were taken in an urban environment. While tinkering with the samples, it felt more like constructing nature than re-creating it.</p>
                    <p>The soundscape is an expression of how distant humans are from pure nature. “Constructed Nature” is about how there is a pure definition of “nature”, that is both necessary and unobtainable to us. It is necessary because we need to visualize an ideal form of nature, that we can infinitely go towards. Without a pure definition of nature, we could make up whatever we want about it, and this happens a lot in politics. It becomes a word that can be used in a strategy. So, a true definition, or pure definition is necessary so that it can have substance that is greater than strategy and politics. It becomes something worthwhile to always try to obtain and to accept we will never obtain it.</p>
                    <p>A laptop instrument was created with a video game joystick to play and affect the Thunder samples. It was made in Max/Msp and it can be an interactive sound installation, if desired. To create the track, I recorded myself using the Thunderstorm Patch/instrument, and then did some processing and editing in Ableton.</p>

                <div class="project-description">
                    <p>In June 2015 I got to be apart of the Fission/Fusion Performance Tours in the Calgary Tower and it was a part of Sage Theatre’s Ignite! Festival and was also presented by Swallow-a-Bicycle. It was also part of a program called the Spark: Artist Performance Tours. There were over a dozen artists involved in the project and each of us got a specific, behind the doors location in the Calgary Tower to create in, including an underground train station.</p>
                    <p>I created a piece called the Multi-Dimensional Emergency Staircase, which, as you could guess was in the emergency staircase of the Calgary Tower, which is the same location I used for the same event in the previous year.
                    <p>Last year, I created a performance/audio piece about Loitering. This year I made an audio only piece about emergencies.</p>
                    <p>The project was site-specific, which means I had to let the space inspire my creation.</p>
                    <p>The Calgary Tower has two stair cases that are criss-crossing to the top of the tower. The criss-crossing stairs make you feel like you are inside of an M.C.Escher drawing. There is a mural on each landing and they are nature themed. Multi-dimensional is a word that definitely describes this space. It is easy to become distracted from the fact that this space is for emergencies but it became the attribute I wanted to focus on.</p>
                    <p>It’s multi-dimensionality inspired me to create something about all Emergencies at once. For me, the goal was to design an audio creation that looks at emergencies universally rather than pinpointing a single one kind of emergency. By using alarms I also wanted to have the audience, for just a split second, think that they are in an emergency and maybe even wonder what they would do in an emergency situation.</p>

The sound was designed by me and used a PD patch to launch the sounds from the keyboard, which the audience member got to use.

                        A performance of some of my experimental electronic music in Ableton Live. For this project I had to design my music to be performance-ready by choosing what was happening in each cue and choosing  what my controllers were doing in each cue, whether it be something automated or something I have to interact with (is this the cue where I play my iPhone instrument?). There was also a visual element to this project where I used a patch in Max for Live called Cell DNA which manipulates video from within Ableton Live, in a separate window on a projection (which they aimed at an array of mirrors). I had a separate midi controller which directly controlled the video.

                    <p>The barriers between inside and out. The challenges of letting something in or pushing it out. This play was about relationships and connection on a universal level.</p>

                    <p>“During the “smooth” part of the passion dance, the sudden introduction of beautiful string quartet music in a soundtrack that up to that point had consisted mainly of spooky babble and haunting drones is electrifying.”
