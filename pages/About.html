                    <p>
                        My name is Kyle Hinton and I’m a father and a multi-disciplined artist who is devoted to sound, puppetry, computer programming, and many other kinds of creative acts. I’m absolutely enthusiastic about creating worlds, telling stories, and exploring philosophy with sound, music, puppets and computers. I’m fascinated by the use of technology to create art and to connect communities. I’m absolutely curious about how people relate through technology and science and philosophy.
                        Amongst my work, you’ll find sound design for theatre and for music, sound installations, electronic music composition, field recording, puppet craft, play writing, performance art and programming.
                        I produce IDM, glitch and experimental electronic music under the name Simulations.
                        I’d describe myself as a futurist in that I embrace technology and its potential for helping humanity and I’m dedicated to finding ways to do that creatively.
                        I’ve been engaged with theatre his entire life and has been creating miniature shows for The Suitcase Theatre Arcade for 11 years. Connecting with people with these short, 3 minute performances, is one of his passions and he has so much gratitude for everyone who shares that interest, enthusiastically and inclusively.
                        I have a Bachelor of arts in drama with a minor in philosophy from the University of Alberta and a certificate in Object Oriented Software Development from The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a developer, I’m passionate about finding ways to combine arts and technology and ways to creatively solve problems. As a software developer and a professional creator, my experiences are diverse and varied. I have unique skills and perspectives to share and I’m willing to step out of my comfort zone to work and gain new perspectives.
                        I wrote my first program in QBasic, when I was in grade7. During that time, I loved to play MUDs, which were text based MMORPGs and I think that playing that game prepared me to navigate through file systems. Travelling in compass directions through a textbased world definitely helped with creating a mental model or mental architecture for navigating through digital space.
                        I went to the University of Calgary for 2 years where I took courses on Python, Java and Assembly language >_<.  Because I was a new father at the time, I needed to speed up my career, so I transferred to the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, where I took the Fast-track Object Oriented Software Development course. This was one of the most practical decisions that I ever made. The program at SAIT was instantly practical. We were introduced to databases right away. Throughout the course we created 3 similar full-stack applications using different stacks of technology. For each, we created a database and frontend for a travel agency, for clients and for staff. The first iteration used MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. The second used ASP .NET and C# and in the third, we used Java, Android. In each project, we used  created a 3 layer approach for handling and securing data. A layer for the user, a logic layer and the database layer.
                        Since graduating from the course I’ve had the pleasure of briefly working at Vog App Developers, for an internship, where we used Android and Java to deploy fullstack mobile applications. After that, I got to work at Shareworks by Morgan Stanley, where I worked as a junior fullstack developer.
                        Since then, I’ve worked as a freelance developer, deploying several projects. Lilly in the Lab is an augmented reality scavengerhunt application that uses mapbox and can have activity locations added through the backend which was made with PHP and MySQL. Disinformation Warriors is a platform for teaching youth about critical thinking and animation that hosts a media library of youth creations. This project was created with Django, Python, Javascript, PostgreSQL and was deployed using Digital Ocean. This site is also internationalized so it can be viewed in French. Augle is an augmented reality application with a backend/dashboard that was made using Django, Django Rest, Python, Unity, C#, PostgreSQL. The game was made using Unity and C# and receives information from the database and media databases, which were deployed using Digital Ocean.

                    <p>
                        On a regular basis, I use Python, Django, HTML, Javascript, React, CSS, Linux, C#, Unity, PHP, Java, JSON, REST and SQL.
                        I’m also proficient with Web3 Solana development as well as Spring Framework,  .NET Entity Framework, Assembly ARMv8, Max/MSP, XML. Photo by Sean Dennie, courtesy of Festival of Animated Objects 2023.
