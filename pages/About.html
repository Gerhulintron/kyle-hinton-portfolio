                My name is Kyle Hinton and I’m a father and a multi-disciplined artist who is devoted to sound, puppetry, computer programming, and many other kinds of creative acts. I’m absolutely enthusiastic about creating worlds, telling stories, and exploring philosophy with sound, music, puppets and computers. I’m fascinated by the use of technology to create art and to connect communities. I’m absolutely curious about how people relate through technology and science and philosophy.
                Amongst my work, you’ll find sound design for theatre and for music, sound installations, electronic music composition, field recording, puppet craft, play writing, performance art and programming.
                I produce IDM, glitch and experimental electronic music under the name Simulations.
                I’d describe myself as a futurist in that I embrace technology and its potential for helping humanity and I’m dedicated to finding ways to do that creatively.
                I’ve been engaged with theatre his entire life and has been creating miniature shows for The Suitcase Theatre Arcade for 11 years. Connecting with people with these short, 3 minute performances, is one of his passions and he has so much gratitude for everyone who shares that interest, enthusiastically and inclusively.
                I have a Bachelor of arts in drama with a minor in philosophy from the University of Alberta and a certificate in Object Oriented Software Development from The Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.

                In the spirit of reconciliation, I acknowledge that we live, work and play on the traditional territories of the Blackfoot Confederacy (Siksika, Kainai, Piikani), the Tsuut’ina, the Îyâxe Nakoda Nations, the Métis Nation (Region 3), and all people who make their homes in the Treaty 7 region of Southern Alberta.
